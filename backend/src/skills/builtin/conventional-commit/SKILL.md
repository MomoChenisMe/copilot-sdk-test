# Conventional Commit

Write git commit messages following the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. For the complete formal specification (16 rules with RFC 2119 keywords), see [references/specification.md](references/specification.md).

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Structure Rules

- The **first line** (header) contains: type, optional scope, optional `!`, colon, space, and description.
- A **blank line** MUST separate the header from the body (if body is present).
- A **blank line** MUST separate the body from the footer section (if footers are present).
- The header (type + scope + description combined) SHOULD be kept under **72 characters**.

## Types

| Type | Purpose | SemVer Impact | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature | MINOR (x.**Y**.z) | Adding new functionality, capabilities, or user-facing behavior |
| `fix` | Bug fix | PATCH (x.y.**Z**) | Correcting incorrect behavior, fixing errors or crashes |
| `build` | Build system / external deps | — | Changes to build tools, npm scripts, webpack, bundler configs, dependency updates |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | — | Routine tasks that don't modify src or test files (e.g., updating .gitignore, tooling configs) |
| `ci` | CI configuration | — | Changes to CI/CD pipeline files (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.) |
| `docs` | Documentation only | — | README, JSDoc, API docs, comments, wikis — no code logic change |
| `style` | Code formatting | — | Whitespace, semicolons, indentation, linting fixes — no logic change. NOT CSS styling |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring | — | Restructuring code without changing external behavior (neither a fix nor a feature) |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | — | Changes that improve performance (faster algorithms, caching, lazy loading) |
| `test` | Tests | — | Adding, correcting, or refactoring tests — no production code change |

- Types other than `feat` and `fix` do NOT directly trigger a SemVer version bump, but MAY appear in changelogs.
- Types MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by tooling, but **lowercase is the most common convention**.
- Custom types beyond this list are allowed by the spec (e.g., `revert`, `merge`), but the above are the standard set.

## Scope

An optional noun in parentheses describing the codebase section affected.

**Format**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Rules**:
- Scope MUST be a **noun** describing a section of the codebase.
- Scope MUST be surrounded by **parentheses**.
- Keep scope names **consistent** within a project.

**Common scope conventions**:
- Module/package name: `feat(auth):`, `fix(parser):`, `refactor(api):`
- Component name: `fix(button):`, `style(navbar):`
- Layer: `feat(backend):`, `fix(frontend):`
- File/area: `docs(readme):`, `ci(github-actions):`

**Examples**:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
fix(parser): handle nested brackets correctly
docs(readme): update installation steps
ci(github-actions): add Node 20 to test matrix
refactor(db): extract connection pooling into separate module
```

## BREAKING CHANGE

Breaking changes indicate incompatible API changes, correlating with **MAJOR** in SemVer (**X**.y.z).

### Two Mechanisms (can coexist)

**1. Append `!` after type/scope** (in the header):
```
feat!: remove deprecated API endpoints
feat(api)!: change response format from array to object
fix!: drop support for Node 14
```

**2. Footer with `BREAKING CHANGE:`** (in the footer section):
```
feat(api): change user response format

BREAKING CHANGE: the /users endpoint now returns an object with a
"data" key instead of a flat array
```

### Rules

- `BREAKING CHANGE` in footers MUST be **uppercase**.
- `BREAKING-CHANGE` (with hyphen) is a valid synonym for `BREAKING CHANGE` in footers.
- `!` can be used with **any** type: `feat!:`, `fix!:`, `refactor!:`, `chore!:`, `build!:`, etc.
- If `!` is used, the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer MAY be omitted — the description after `!:` SHALL describe the breaking change.
- Both mechanisms can be used together for emphasis:
  ```
  refactor!: drop support for Node 14

  BREAKING CHANGE: minimum Node.js version is now 18.x
  ```

## Footer Format

Footers follow the [git trailer convention](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).

### Format

```
<token><separator><value>
```

- **Token**: A word or hyphenated words (e.g., `Reviewed-by`, `Refs`, `Closes`).
  - Token MUST use **`-` (hyphen) in place of whitespace** characters.
  - Exception: `BREAKING CHANGE` (with space) is allowed as a token.
- **Separator**: Either `:<space>` (colon + space) or `<space>#` (space + hash).
- **Value**: A string that MAY contain spaces and newlines.
  - Parsing terminates when the next valid token/separator pair is observed.

### Common Footer Tokens

| Token | Separator | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BREAKING CHANGE` | `: ` | Describe breaking API change | `BREAKING CHANGE: env vars now override config` |
| `BREAKING-CHANGE` | `: ` | Synonym for BREAKING CHANGE | `BREAKING-CHANGE: removed legacy auth` |
| `Refs` | `: ` | Reference issues/PRs | `Refs: #123, #456` |
| `Closes` | `: ` | Auto-close issues | `Closes: #789` |
| `Fixes` | ` #` | Auto-close issues (alt) | `Fixes #101` |
| `Reviewed-by` | `: ` | Code reviewer attribution | `Reviewed-by: Alice <alice@example.com>` |
| `Acked-by` | `: ` | Acknowledgment | `Acked-by: Bob` |
| `Co-Authored-By` | `: ` | Co-author attribution | `Co-Authored-By: Name <email>` |
| `Signed-off-by` | `: ` | Sign-off (DCO) | `Signed-off-by: Dev <dev@example.com>` |

### Multi-Footer Example

```
feat(api): add user endpoint

Add GET /users and POST /users endpoints with pagination support.
Rate limiting is set to 100 requests per minute.

```

## Writing Guidelines

1. **Imperative mood** in the description: "add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature". Think of it as completing the sentence: "If applied, this commit will _[your description]_."
2. **No period** at the end of the description line.
3. **Lowercase** the first letter of the description (after the colon and space).
4. **Under 72 characters** for the full header line (type + scope + description).
5. **Body explains WHY**, not WHAT: The diff shows what changed; the body should explain the motivation, context, and reasoning behind the change.
6. **One logical change per commit**: Do not mix unrelated changes. If a commit touches authentication and also fixes a typo in an unrelated file, split them into two commits.
7. **Blank line** between header and body, and between body and footers — this is required by the spec and by git tooling.
8. **Wrap body text** at 72 characters per line for readability in terminal-based git tools.

## Examples

### Minimal (description only)

```
docs: correct typo in contributing guide
```

```
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

```
style: fix indentation in auth module
```

```
test: add unit tests for password validation
```

### With Scope

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
```

```
fix(parser): handle empty input without crashing
```

```
perf(images): add lazy loading for gallery thumbnails
```

```
refactor(db): extract connection pooling into separate module
```

### With Body

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support

Implement OAuth2 authorization code flow to allow users to
authenticate with GitHub and Google accounts. This replaces the
legacy username/password authentication for third-party providers.
```

```
fix(parser): handle empty input without crashing

Return empty result instead of throwing NullPointerException
when parser receives null or empty string input. The root cause
was a missing null check in the tokenizer's init method.
```

### With Body and Footers

```
feat(api): add user search endpoint

Add GET /users/search endpoint supporting full-text search
across name and email fields with pagination. Results are
sorted by relevance score by default.

Refs: #234
Reviewed-by: Alice <alice@example.com>
```

```
fix(auth): prevent session fixation attack

Regenerate session ID after successful authentication to prevent
session fixation attacks. The old session data is migrated to the
new session automatically.

Closes: #891
Signed-off-by: Security Team <security@example.com>
```

### BREAKING CHANGE

```
feat!: drop support for Node 14

BREAKING CHANGE: minimum Node.js version is now 18.x.
Update your CI/CD pipelines and deployment environments accordingly.
```

```
feat(api)!: change response envelope format

Wrap all API responses in a standard envelope with "data", "meta",
and "errors" keys. Previously, endpoints returned raw data arrays.

BREAKING CHANGE: all API responses now use { data, meta, errors }
envelope format instead of returning raw arrays.

Refs: #567
```

### Revert

```
revert: let us never again speak of the noodle incident

Refs: 676104e, a]215868
```
